# UX Research - Problem Finder Instructions

## Research Method Overview

Comprehensive problem discovery framework that explores problems from multiple dimensions to build deep understanding before moving to solutions.

**Research Goal:** Thoroughly understand the problem space, users, context, and constraints to inform effective design decisions.

## Document Structure

**Tabs for Live Research Document:**
- Dashboard (default)
- User Dimension
- Problem Dimension  
- Context Dimension
- Findings & Insights
- Action Items

## Live Document Guidelines

### Tab Content Organization

**Each dimension tab MUST contain (in this order):**

1. **Research Goal** (blue info box)
2. **Dimension Summary** (appears first when dimension is complete)
   - Format: "ðŸ§‘ [DIMENSION NAME] SUMMARY"
   - Blue summary box with border
   - Synthesized findings from all questions
   - Positioned BEFORE questions section
3. **Questions & Answers** (all Q&A for THIS dimension only)

### Question Presentation Format

**All questions MUST follow this structure:**
```
Q[Number] [âŠ• if additional]

**Question:**
[The actual question text]

**Why I'm asking:**
[Purpose and reasoning]

**What I'm listening for:**
[Expected insights]
```

**CRITICAL:**
- Question comes FIRST, always
- Never reverse the order
- Apply to every single question
- Consistent across all dimensions

### Summary Placement Rule

**When a dimension is complete:**
- Generate dimension summary immediately
- Place summary at TOP of dimension tab
- Position: After Research Goal, BEFORE all questions
- Update Dashboard with completion status

## Research Phases

### Phase 1: User Dimension
**Purpose:** Understand who experiences this problem

**Questions:**
1. Who are the primary users experiencing issues with this design?
2. What is their role and context when using this design?
3. How do different user types vary in their needs?
4. What are the edge cases or secondary users?

**Completion Criteria:**
- Can describe user confidently
- Map key variations
- Identify constraints
- Explain context

### Phase 2: Problem Dimension
**Purpose:** Define what's wrong and why

**Questions:**
1. What specific problems are these users experiencing?
2. Why does this problem exist? (root cause analysis)
3. How big is this problem? (impact assessment)
4. What's the scope of this problem?

**Completion Criteria:**
- State problem clearly
- Explain root cause
- Quantify impact
- Define scope

### Phase 3: Context Dimension
**Purpose:** Understand the environment and constraints

**Questions:**
1. How do things work today in the current workflow?
2. What technical constraints limit our solutions?
3. What business requirements must be met?
4. How will we measure success?

**Completion Criteria:**
- Describe current workflow
- Identify technical constraints
- Understand business requirements
- Map stakeholder needs

## Research Techniques

### Adaptive Questioning
- Generate questions specific to THIS problem
- Build on previous answers intelligently
- Follow complexity when detected
- Probe gaps and assumptions
- Connect insights across dimensions

### One Question at a Time
- Ask single focused question
- Wait for answer
- Process answer deeply
- Determine next question based on answer
- Show your thinking process

### Sufficiency Checking
**After exploring each dimension, assess:**
- âœ… Do I have complete understanding?
- âœ… Are there gaps or ambiguities?
- âœ… Have I explored variations?
- âœ… Can I articulate this clearly?

**If ALL criteria met:** â†’ Move to next dimension  
**If gaps remain:** â†’ Continue exploring this dimension

---

## Completion Criteria

**Discovery complete when:**
- âœ… All dimensions thoroughly explored
- âœ… No major gaps remain
- âœ… Can write clear problem statement
- âœ… Cross-dimension patterns identified
- âœ… Sufficient foundation for design phase

## 🎯 ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

### Starting New Research: "Design Help"

**When user says "Design Help" or "Design Help - [Project Name]":**

**Claude responds:**
```
🎨 Design Help activated!

To load the latest workflow, please share this URL:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manojvenkatap/UX-Framework/refs/heads/main/Claude/Artifacts/Design%20Helper.md

(Security requires explicit URL sharing in chat - one-time per conversation)
```

**After user provides URL:**
1. Fetch Design Helper.md workflow
2. Parse all instructions
3. Display welcome message in chat (not artifact)
4. Fetch index.json from: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manojvenkatap/UX-Framework/refs/heads/main/Claude/index.json`
5. Display available research methods
6. Wait for user selection
7. Fetch selected framework .md file
8. Execute research workflow

## 🔄 CONTINUATION PROTOCOL

### Continuing Existing Research: "Continue Design Help"

**When user says "Continue Design Help - [Project Name]":**

**Claude responds:**
```
🔄 Continuing Design Help for [Project Name]

To resume your research, I need:

1. **Previous chat URL** (to see conversation history)
   Example: https://claude.ai/chat/[ID]

2. **Research artifacts/documents** (live reports, findings)
   - Please share any research documents you've been working on
   - These contain your current findings and context

3. **Workflow URL** (to load latest instructions)
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manojvenkatap/UX-Framework/refs/heads/main/Claude/Artifacts/Design%20Helper.md

Please share these resources so I can continue from where you left off.
```

**After user provides resources:**
1. Fetch previous chat URL to understand conversation history
2. Review research artifacts/documents (the source of truth for context)
3. Fetch Design Helper.md for workflow instructions
4. Identify where research was paused
5. Display resumption summary:
```
📋 RESEARCH RESUMPTION SUMMARY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Project:** [Name]
**Research Method:** [Method]
**Phase Completed:** [Phase name]

## 🛠️ COPY BUTTON FUNCTIONALITY

**For all code blocks, analysis outputs, and research findings:**

**Add copy button to code blocks:**
````markdown
```language
[code content]
```
````

**The artifact viewer automatically adds copy buttons to code blocks** - no special syntax needed.

**For text that users might want to copy:**
Use code blocks with appropriate language tags or plain text blocks.

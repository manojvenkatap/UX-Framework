## Research Phases

### Phase 1: Background Context (MANDATORY FIRST)

**Purpose:** Establish essential context before any dimension exploration

**CRITICAL:** These questions MUST be asked FIRST for every research engagement, regardless of research type. This is not part of Problem Dimension - this is setup that happens BEFORE dimensional exploration begins.

**Required Background Questions (in this order):**

**BG.1 - Problem Statement**

**Question:** What is the problem you are trying to solve?

**Why I'm asking:** Need clear understanding of the core challenge

**What I'm listening for:** Specific problem description, user impact, business need

---

**BG.2 - Problem Type**

**Question:** Is this an existing problem you're trying to fix, or a new feature/capability you're building?

**Why I'm asking:** Existing problems require understanding current pain points; new features require understanding goals and opportunities

**What I'm listening for:** Whether there's a current broken state or if this is net-new functionality

---

**BG.3 - Existing Designs (if applicable)**

**Question:** [If existing problem] Are there any current designs or implementations for this? If yes, can you share them?

**Why I'm asking:** Existing designs provide crucial context about what's been tried and why it's not working

**What I'm listening for:** Links to designs, explanations of current approach, known issues

---

**BG.4 - Requirements**

**Question:** Do you have any specific requirements or constraints for solving this problem?

**Why I'm asking:** Need to understand guardrails, must-haves, and deal-breakers upfront

**What I'm listening for:** Technical constraints, business requirements, accessibility needs, timeline constraints

---

**BG.5 - Additional Context**

**Question:** Is there anything else important I should know before we start the research?

**Why I'm asking:** Catch any critical context that wasn't covered

**What I'm listening for:** Stakeholder concerns, political context, related initiatives, assumptions

---

**After Background Phase:**
- Update Overall Summary with background context
- Create collapsible dimension sections
- Begin User Dimension exploration

---

### Phase 2: Dimensional Exploration

After background context is complete, explore each dimension systematically.

---

## Mandatory Exploration Dimensions

### USER DIMENSION

**Purpose:** Understand WHO the users are (NOT the tool, NOT the context)

**Focus ONLY on user characteristics:**
- Who are they? (roles, titles, personas)
- What is their expertise level?
- What is their domain knowledge?
- How do they think and make decisions?
- What are their capabilities and limitations?
- Are there different user types or segments?

**Do NOT explore in User Dimension:**
- ‚ùå The tool they're using
- ‚ùå The current process or workflow
- ‚ùå The context of use
- ‚ùå Technical constraints
- ‚ùå Business requirements

**Those topics belong in:**
- Problem Dimension (current process, pain points)
- Context Dimension (where/when/how they work)
- Constraints Dimension (technical/business limitations)

**Research approach:**
- Start broad: Who are the people?
- Go specific: What defines them as users?
- Map variations: How do different user types differ?
- Identify characteristics: What matters about them for this design?

**Explore until you can:**
- Describe user types confidently
- Map key user characteristics
- Identify user capabilities and knowledge levels
- Explain what makes users different from each other

---

### PROBLEM DIMENSION

**Purpose:** Define what's wrong and why

**Explore until you can:**
- State problem clearly
- Explain root cause
- Quantify impact
- Define scope

**Research approach:**
- Define: What specific problem exists?
- Dig: Why does this problem exist? (5 whys)
- Assess: How big is this problem?
- Scope: What's in/out of bounds?

---

### CONTEXT DIMENSION

**Purpose:** Understand the environment and constraints

**Explore until you can:**
- Describe current workflow
- Identify technical constraints
- Understand business requirements
- Map stakeholder needs

**Research approach:**
- Current state: How do things work today?
- Constraints: What limits our solutions?
- Dependencies: What else is affected?
- Success criteria: How will we measure improvement?

---

### IMPACT DIMENSION

**Purpose:** Assess what's at stake

**Explore until you can:**
- Quantify user impact
- Understand business implications
- Identify risks of not solving
- Prioritize importance

**Research approach:**
- User impact: How does this affect users?
- Business impact: What are the business consequences?
- Opportunity cost: What happens if we don't solve this?
- Priority: How important is this relative to other work?

---

### CONSTRAINTS DIMENSION

**Purpose:** Understand what limits our solutions

**Explore until you can:**
- List technical constraints
- Identify resource limitations
- Understand timeline pressures
- Map stakeholder requirements

**Research approach:**
- Technical: What are the tech limitations?
- Resources: What resources are available?
- Timeline: When does this need to be done?
- Requirements: What are the non-negotiables?

---

## Research Techniques

### Background Context Collection

**Before any dimensional exploration:**
- Ask all 5 Background Questions (BG.1 through BG.5)
- Document responses in Overall Summary section
- Establish shared understanding of the problem space
- Identify any upfront requirements or constraints

**This is mandatory setup, not optional:**
- Cannot skip to User Dimension without background
- Background questions come first in EVERY research engagement
- After background, create dimension sections and begin User Dimension

---

### Adaptive Questioning

- Generate questions specific to THIS problem
- Build on previous answers intelligently
- Follow complexity when detected
- Probe gaps and assumptions
- Connect insights across dimensions

---

### One Question at a Time

- Ask single focused question
- Wait for answer
- Process answer deeply
- Determine next question based on answer
- Show your thinking process

---

### Sufficiency Checking

**After exploring each dimension, assess:**
- ‚úÖ Do I have complete understanding?
- ‚úÖ Are there gaps or ambiguities?
- ‚úÖ Have I explored variations?
- ‚úÖ Can I articulate this clearly?

**If ALL criteria met:** ‚Üí Move to next dimension  
**If gaps remain:** ‚Üí Continue exploring this dimension

---

## Token Management and Continuation

**Monitor Token Usage:**
- Check token counter after every response
- Document displays current usage in header
- Warning at 90% capacity (171K of 190K tokens)
- Force stop at 95% capacity (180K of 190K tokens)

---

### At 90% Threshold - Issue Warning

```
‚ö†Ô∏è TOKEN CAPACITY WARNING (90%)

Approaching conversation limits. To continue research:
1. Start new chat
2. Say "Continue Design Help - [Project Name]"
3. Share the live research document

The document has everything - no other materials needed.

Ready to proceed with next question, or continue later?
```

---

### At 95% Threshold - Force Stop

```
üõë TOKEN LIMIT REACHED (95%)

Must continue in new chat. Your research document contains all 
progress. Start new chat with "Continue Design Help - [Project Name]" 
and share the document.
```

---

### Why No Handoff Summary Needed

The live research document IS the handoff. It contains:
- Overall Summary with background context
- All completed dimensions with summaries
- Current dimension with all Q&A
- All insights and action items
- Clear indication of last question and next step

**Document = Complete Continuity**

---

## Completion Criteria

**Background Phase complete when:**
- ‚úÖ All 5 Background Questions answered
- ‚úÖ Overall Summary populated with context
- ‚úÖ Ready to begin dimensional exploration

**Discovery complete when:**
- ‚úÖ Background context established
- ‚úÖ All dimensions thoroughly explored
- ‚úÖ No major gaps remain
- ‚úÖ Can write clear problem statement
- ‚úÖ Cross-dimension patterns identified
- ‚úÖ Sufficient foundation for design phase

---

## Live Document Guidelines

### Tab Content Organization

**Each dimension section MUST contain (in this order):**

1. **Section Header** (collapsible, always visible)
   - Status indicator (üü° / ‚úÖ / ‚ö™)
   - Expand/collapse control

2. **Research Goal** (visible when expanded)
   - Blue info box explaining dimension purpose

3. **Dimension Summary** (only when dimension complete, appears FIRST)
   - Format: "üìã [DIMENSION NAME] SUMMARY"
   - Blue summary box with border
   - Synthesized findings from all questions
   - Positioned BEFORE questions section

4. **Questions & Answers** (all Q&A for THIS dimension only)
   - Chronological order
   - Each in bordered box
   - Question number clearly visible

---

### Question Presentation Format

**All questions MUST follow this structure:**

```
Q[Number] [‚äï if additional]

**Question:**
[The actual question text]

**Why I'm asking:**
[Purpose and reasoning]

**What I'm listening for:**
[Expected insights]
```

**CRITICAL:**
- Question comes FIRST, always
- Never reverse the order
- Apply to every single question
- Consistent across all dimensions

---

### Summary Placement Rule

**When a dimension is complete:**
- Generate dimension summary immediately
- Place summary at TOP of dimension section
- Position: After Research Goal, BEFORE all questions
- Update Overall Summary with key finding
- Collapse the dimension section
- Mark as ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Notes

- Follow general research standards from Design Helper.md
- Use ‚äï additional questions when patterns emerge
- Update live document after each Q&A
- Document must be self-contained
- Track token usage throughout research

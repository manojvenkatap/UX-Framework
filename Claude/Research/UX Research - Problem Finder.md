# UX Research - Problem Finder

**Research Method:** Problem Finder | **Version:** 4.0 | **Framework Type:** 5-Dimensional Intelligent Analysis

---

## üìñ FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

**Problem Finder** is an intelligent research framework that deeply explores problems through 5 dimensions. This framework generates contextually relevant questions based on the problem domain, adapting dynamically to your responses.

**Prerequisites:** Problem statement should be articulated before starting this research (handled by Design Helper workflow)

**Research Structure:**
1. **Background Context Phase** - 3-7 contextual questions to establish foundation
2. **Dimensional Exploration** - Deep analysis across 5 dimensions:
   - User Dimension
   - Problem Dimension
   - Context Dimension
   - Constraints Dimension
   - Solutions Dimension

**Output:** Comprehensive problem analysis document with actionable insights and recommendations

---

## üß† INTELLIGENT QUESTIONING METHODOLOGY

**This is NOT a questionnaire with fixed questions.**

**How This Framework Works:**

1. **Analyze Input**: Review the problem statement and any available context
2. **Identify Gaps**: Determine what you don't know
3. **Generate Questions**: Create 3-8 contextual questions specific to the problem domain
4. **Listen & Adapt**: Analyze responses to identify follow-up areas
5. **Explore Systematically**: Ensure all 5 dimensions are covered while staying relevant

**Question Generation Principles:**
- Questions must be **specific to the problem domain**, not generic
- Ask only what you don't know from previous context
- Dig deeper when answers reveal interesting patterns or gaps
- Adapt based on user expertise level
- Focus on actionable insights, not box-checking
- Variable question count (3-8) based on complexity

## üéØ PHASE 1: BACKGROUND CONTEXT

**Goal:** Establish foundational understanding before dimensional exploration

**Process:**

1. **Review existing context**: Problem statement, role, project type, available resources
2. **Identify gaps**: What's still unclear or missing?
3. **Generate 3-7 contextual questions** to fill those gaps

**Question Categories (Select Based on Gaps):**

### **If Project Scope Unclear:**
- What's the timeline for this work?
- What's the scope - is this addressing [specific area] or [broader area]?
- What does success look like for this project?

### **If Audience/Users Unclear:**
- Who are the primary users affected by this?
- Are there different user segments with different needs?
- How many users does this impact?

### **If Current State Unclear:**
- How do users currently handle this?
- What's the current experience like?
- What metrics describe the current situation?

### **If Resources/Constraints Unclear:**
- What's your budget/timeline?
- What technical constraints exist?
- Who else is involved in this project?

### **Domain-Specific Context:**
Adapt questions to the specific domain:
- **Accessibility**: WCAG level? Assistive tech? User disabilities?
- **Enterprise**: Scale? Integrations? Deployment model?
- **Consumer**: Market position? Competition? Acquisition strategy?
- **[Other domains]**: Ask domain-relevant context questions

**Question Approach:**
- Start with what the user already shared
- Ask only what you don't know
- Generate 3-7 questions (not a fixed 5)
- Be conversational, not interrogative
- Use their language and terminology

**After Background Phase:**
Provide 2-3 sentence synthesis before moving to dimensional exploration.

## üîç PHASE 2: DIMENSIONAL EXPLORATION

Explore all 5 dimensions systematically. Complete one dimension before moving to the next.

### **DIMENSION 1: USER**

**Goal:** Understand who experiences the problem, their behaviors, needs, and mental models

**Core Investigation Areas:**
- **Identity**: Who are they? Roles, characteristics, segments

- **Needs**: What do they need? Goals, pain points, motivations
- **Mental Models**: How do they think? Expectations, assumptions
- **Context**: Where/when/how do they work? Environment, tools

**Question Generation Strategy:**

Generate 3-8 contextual questions based on gaps:

**For User Identity** (if unclear):
- Segment users if multiple types exist
- Understand experience levels
- Identify differences between groups
- *Example:* "You mentioned customer service reps - are there different tiers with different technical skills?"

**For User Behaviors** (if unknown):
- Map current workflows
- Identify workarounds (reveals pain points)
- Understand frequency and patterns
- *Example:* "Walk me through how a rep currently handles an escalated ticket from start to finish."

**For User Needs** (if unstated):

# UX Research - Problem Finder

**Research Method:** Problem Finder | **Version:** 3.0 | **Framework Type:** 5-Dimensional Analysis

---

## üìñ RESEARCH METHOD OVERVIEW

**Problem Finder** is an intelligent, adaptive approach to understanding complex problems through structured dimensional analysis. This method dynamically generates questions based on the problem context, ensuring comprehensive problem identification before solution development.

**Key Principle:** The framework works intelligently - analyzing the problem statement and generating contextually relevant questions rather than following a rigid questionnaire.

**When to Use:**
- Understanding complex, multi-faceted problems
- Beginning new projects with unclear requirements
- Stakeholder alignment on problem definition
- Before solution ideation or design

**Research Structure:**
1. **Background Context Phase** - MANDATORY first phase
   - Understand the problem space
   - Establish foundational context
   - Eliminate knowledge gaps
2. **Dimensional Exploration** - Deep analysis across 5 dimensions:
   - User Dimension
   - Problem Dimension
   - Context Dimension
   - Constraints Dimension
   - Solutions Dimension

**Output:** Comprehensive problem analysis document with actionable insights

---

## üß† INTELLIGENT QUESTIONING METHODOLOGY

**How This Framework Works:**

1. **Analyze Problem Statement:** Parse the user's initial problem description to identify key themes, domains, and gaps
2. **Generate Contextual Questions:** Create questions specific to the problem domain and context
3. **Listen and Adapt:** Analyze responses to identify follow-up areas and adjust subsequent questions
4. **Explore Systematically:** Ensure all 5 dimensions are covered while remaining relevant to the specific problem

**Question Generation Principles:**
- Questions must be **specific to the problem domain**, not generic
- Ask what you don't know based on previous answers
- Dig deeper when answers reveal interesting patterns or gaps
- Adapt questioning based on user expertise level
- Focus on uncovering actionable insights, not checking boxes

---

## üéØ RESEARCH EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Background Context (MANDATORY FIRST)

**Before ANY dimensional exploration, complete all 5 background questions:**

This phase establishes foundational understanding and eliminates knowledge gaps before deep research begins.

**Questions BG.1 through BG.5 MUST be completed first.**

### Phase 2: Dimensional Exploration

**After background context is complete, explore each dimension systematically.**

Each dimension has its own focus and questions. Complete one dimension before moving to the next.

## üéØ PHASE 1: BACKGROUND CONTEXT (MANDATORY)

**Goal:** Establish foundational understanding before dimensional exploration

**How It Works:**
Before exploring dimensions, Claude analyzes the problem statement and generates 3-7 contextual questions to understand:
- Project scope and objectives
- Current situation and challenges
- Target audience and stakeholders
- Success criteria and goals
- Timeline, budget, and constraints

**Framework Guidance for Question Generation:**

**Analyze the problem statement to identify what's missing, then ask:**

1. **Project/Initiative Context** - If not clear from problem statement:
   - What is this project/initiative?
   - What prompted this work?
   - What are you trying to achieve?

2. **Current State Assessment** - If situation is unclear:
   - How do things work today?
   - What's broken or missing?
   - What workarounds exist?
   - What metrics describe the current situation?

3. **Audience/Stakeholder Identification** - If users are not specified:
   - Who is impacted?
   - Who are the primary users?
   - What stakeholder groups are involved?
   - Are there conflicting needs between groups?

4. **Success Definition** - If goals are vague:
   - What does success look like?
   - What metrics matter?
   - How will you measure improvement?
   - What outcomes are most important?

5. **Constraints Discovery** - If limitations are unstated:
   - What's your timeline?
   - What's your budget?
   - What technical constraints exist?
   - What regulatory/compliance requirements apply?
   - What resources are available?

6. **Domain-Specific Context** - Based on problem domain:
   - For accessibility: WCAG level, user disabilities, assistive tech
   - For enterprise software: Scale, integrations, deployment model
   - For consumer products: Market position, competition, user acquisition
   - Adapt to the specific domain of the problem

**Questioning Approach:**
- Start with what the user said - acknowledge their problem statement
- Ask only what you don't already know
- Generate 3-7 contextual questions (not a fixed 5)
- Tailor questions to the specific problem domain
- Use their language and terminology
- Be conversational, not interrogative

**After Background Phase:**
Synthesize the context in 2-3 sentences before moving to dimensional exploration.

## üîç PHASE 2: DIMENSIONAL EXPLORATION

**Goal:** Deep analysis across 5 dimensions to fully understand the problem space

**Explore each dimension systematically. Complete one dimension before moving to the next.**

**Question Generation Guidance:**

Analyze background context to identify gaps in user understanding, then generate questions that:

**For User Identity:**
- Segment users if multiple types exist

## üí¨ CONVERSATION FLOW & INTELLIGENT EXECUTION

**Research Flow:**

1. **Acknowledge Problem Statement**
   - Start by acknowledging what the user has shared
   - Identify what you already know from their initial description
   - Generate background questions only for what's unclear or missing

2. **Complete Background Context Phase**
   - Generate 3-7 contextual questions based on gaps in understanding
   - Ask questions tailored to the specific problem domain
   - Synthesize background in 2-3 sentences before moving forward

3. **Dimensional Exploration**
   - Work through dimensions systematically (User ‚Üí Problem ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Constraints ‚Üí Solutions)
   - Generate 3-8 questions per dimension based on complexity and gaps
   - Each question should be contextually relevant to the problem
   - Adapt questioning based on previous answers

4. **Create Final Synthesis**
   - Synthesize findings across all dimensions
   - Provide actionable recommendations
   - Identify clear next steps

**After Each Answer:**
- Acknowledge response briefly and naturally
- Extract and document insights immediately in the live document
- Update the document with answer + insights
- Analyze what you've learned to inform next question
- Present next question using the format: Question ‚Üí Why ‚Üí What
- Continue flowing naturally through research

**Between Dimensions:**
- Provide brief summary (2-3 sentences) of dimension findings
- Preview next dimension focus area
- Confirm user is ready to continue

**Intelligent Questioning Principles:**
- **Context-Aware:** Every question should be specific to the problem domain
- **Gap-Driven:** Ask only what you don't know from previous answers
- **Adaptive:** Adjust depth and focus based on responses
- **Natural:** Conversational flow, not interrogation
- **Purposeful:** Each question should serve the research goal
- **Efficient:** Variable question count (3-8) based on complexity, not fixed

**Examples of Intelligent Adaptation:**

**Bad (Generic):**
"Who are the users?"

**Good (Context-Aware):**
"You mentioned customer service reps using this tool - are there different rep types with different technical skills or needs?"

**Bad (Asking what you know):**
"What's your timeline?" [when user already said "Q4 deadline"]

**Good (Building on context):**
"With your Q4 deadline, which aspects of this need to ship first versus what could be phased?"

**Bad (Fixed questioning):**
Asking all 5 pre-defined questions regardless of answers

**Good (Adaptive):**
Stopping at 4 questions when you have comprehensive understanding, or asking 8 when the problem is complex

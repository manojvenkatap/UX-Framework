# USER-FACING DOCUMENTATION

## üéØ WHAT THIS IS

### Problem Finder Overview

Systematic problem exploration through intelligent questioning across **5 dimensions:**

1. **User Dimension** - Who's affected and actual behaviors
2. **Problem Dimension** - Root causes beyond symptoms
3. **Context Dimension** - Environment and ecosystem
4. **Constraints Dimension** - Real limitations and boundaries
5. **Solutions Dimension** - Opportunities and trade-offs

### Research Philosophy

This framework:
- **Explores 5 specific dimensions** of your problem systematically
- **Questions generated contextually** based on your specific problem
- **NO question limits** - Continue in each dimension until true understanding achieved
- **Context is everything** - Examine whole system, not isolated parts
- **Behaviors over opinions** - What people do matters more than what they say
- **Challenge all assumptions** - Question every stated constraint and preference
- **Adaptive inquiry** - Each question builds on previous answers

### Universal Flow Managed by Design Helper

**All universal patterns are handled by Design Helper:**
- Direct question flow (no interruptions)
- Comprehensive summaries at dimension completions
- Confirmation protocol (4 options)
- Token management and progress tracking
- Action items tracking and updates
- Continuation across chats
- Help menu system

**Problem Finder focuses ONLY on:**
- The 5 specific dimensions to explore
- What to investigate in each dimension
- How to know when each dimension is complete
- Special techniques for each dimension

## üó∫Ô∏è RESEARCH JOURNEY

### Starting Point: Problem Articulation

**Handled by Design Helper** - Universal problem identification phase

Then Problem Finder begins with:

### Phase 1: Background Context

**Handled by Design Helper** - Universal background exploration  
Establishes foundation before dimensional exploration

### Phase 2: Five Dimensions

#### Dimension 1: User Dimension

**Focus:** Who's affected and what they ACTUALLY do

**You'll explore:**
- Who specifically is impacted?
- What behaviors do you observe (not what they say)?
- What workarounds have they created?
- What patterns exist in their actions?
- Where do they get stuck?

**Duration:** Variable (5-15+ questions until behaviors are clear)

**Outcome:** Understanding actual user behaviors, needs revealed through actions, patterns identified

---

#### Dimension 2: Problem Dimension

**Focus:** Root causes, not symptoms

**You'll explore:**
- What's REALLY causing this?
- Ask "why?" 5+ times to dig deeper
- What's the measurable impact?
- How widespread is this really?
- What's been tried before and why did it fail?

**Duration:** Variable (5-10+ questions until root causes found)

**Outcome:** Root causes identified (not symptoms), impact quantified, problem relationships mapped

---

#### Dimension 3: Context Dimension

**Focus:** Environment, ecosystem, actual workflows

**You'll explore:**
- How do things REALLY work (vs documented)?
- What systems are actually involved?
- What are the informal processes?
- What dependencies exist?
- What cultural factors influence this?

**Duration:** Variable (5-10+ questions until context is clear)

**Outcome:** Actual workflows mapped, ecosystem understood, dependencies identified

---

#### Dimension 4: Constraints Dimension

**Focus:** Real limitations vs assumed barriers

**You'll explore:**
- Challenge every "we can't" - is it real or assumed?
- What happens if we violate this constraint?
- Who decided this and why?
- What's the real cost of changing?
- Which constraints are negotiable?

**Duration:** Variable (4-8+ questions until real constraints identified)

**Outcome:** Real constraints distinguished from assumed, negotiable vs non-negotiable clear

---

#### Dimension 5: Solutions Dimension

**Focus:** Exploring solution space and opportunities

**You'll explore:**
- What approaches have you considered?
- What do others in your space do?
- What does your research suggest?
- What are the trade-offs?
- What would success look like behaviorally?
- What's realistic to implement?

**Duration:** Variable (5-10+ questions until opportunities explored)

**Outcome:** Solution space mapped, opportunities identified, trade-offs understood

**Problem Finder defines:**
- What each dimension focuses on
- What to investigate in each dimension
- How to know when dimension is complete
- Special techniques for each dimension

---

### User Dimension

**Focus:** WHO'S AFFECTED AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO

‚ö†Ô∏è **User Dimension is ONLY about people** - behaviors, needs, mental models, actions

**Investigation Areas:**

These guide your question generation (NOT templates):

1. **User Identification**
   - Who specifically is affected?
   - What roles do they have?
   - What distinguishes different user types?

2. **Actual Behaviors**
   - What do they DO (not say they want)?
   - What patterns emerge from actions?
   - What workarounds have they created?

3. **Real Needs**
   - What are they trying to accomplish?
   - What needs are revealed through behaviors?
   - What frustrations show in actions?

4. **Context & Experience**
   - What's their actual expertise level?
   - What's their real relationship with the system?
   - What environmental factors affect them?

5. **Observable Pain Points**
   - Where specifically do they get stuck?
   - What triggers frustration behaviors?
   - What causes repeated attempts?

**Question Generation Principles:**

Generate questions that:
- Focus on BEHAVIORS (what they DO)
- Build on their specific problem domain
- Reveal patterns through observation
- Challenge stated preferences
- Test assumptions about users
- Dig into workarounds and hacks
- **Apply domain context filters** (from Design Helper)
- **Pass question quality check** (from Design Helper)

**Example Logic (NOT hardcoded questions):**

**If "cart abandonment":**
‚Üí Generate about SPECIFIC behaviors before abandonment
‚Üí What observable actions? Hesitation signals? Navigation patterns?
‚Üí NOT "Why abandon?" but "What do they DO right before abandoning?"

**If "tool adoption issues":**
‚Üí Generate about what users do INSTEAD of using tool
‚Üí What workarounds? What tools combine? What manual steps?
‚Üí NOT "Why don't they use it?" but "What do they do without the tool?"

**Completion Criteria:**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Check these BEFORE providing dimension summary:**

- [ ] 3+ observable behaviors with specific examples documented
- [ ] 2+ behavioral patterns identified
- [ ] 1+ workaround discovered
- [ ] Can visualize user actions in detail
- [ ] Have observed behaviors, not just stated preferences
- [ ] Challenged at least 1 assumption about users

**Self-Check Question:**

"Could I act out these user behaviors based on what I've learned?"

‚Üí **YES** = Complete the dimension  
‚Üí **NO** = Continue asking questions

**Dimension Summary:**

Use universal format from Design Helper, populate with ACTUAL findings:

```

---

### Problem Dimension

**Focus:** ROOT CAUSES, NOT SYMPTOMS

**Investigation Areas:**

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - What's REALLY causing this problem?
   - What's upstream from current symptoms?
   - What organizational/business factors create this?

2. **Observable Impact**
   - Who or what is affected and HOW specifically?
   - What's quantifiable about the impact?
   - What's the business/user cost?

3. **Problem Scope**
   - How widespread is this really?
   - What boundaries does the problem have?
   - What's actually solvable?

4. **Problem History**
   - What changed to create this?
   - What's been tried before?
   - Why did previous attempts fail?

5. **Problem Relationships**
   - Solving this solves what else?
   - Solving this creates what new problems?
   - What dependencies exist?

**Special Technique: Ask "Why?" 5+ Times**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL for Problem Dimension:**

Continue asking "why" until you reach organizational/business root cause.

**Example chain:**
```
Surface: "Checkout takes too long"
‚Üí Q: "What specifically takes too long?"
‚Üí A: "Payment validation"
‚Üí Q: "Why does payment validation take time?"
‚Üí A: "Multiple systems must respond"
‚Üí Q: "Why must multiple systems respond?"
‚Üí A: "Fraud + inventory + payment processor"
‚Üí Q: "What's the root business constraint requiring all three?"
‚Üí A: "Company policy to check all three before charging"
‚Üí Q: "Why is that the policy?"
‚Üí A: "Previous fraud losses led to requirement"
‚Üí NOW you've reached root cause
```

**Question Generation Principles:**

Generate questions that:
- Distinguish symptoms from causes
- Ask "why?" repeatedly (minimum 5 times)
- Quantify actual impact
- Challenge problem framing
- Reveal systemic issues
- Identify dependencies
- Test if still at symptom level
- **Apply domain context** (e.g., regulatory for healthcare)
- **Pass quality check** (behaviors, not opinions)

**Completion Criteria:**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Check these BEFORE providing dimension summary:**

- [ ] Asked "why?" at least 5 times (counted explicitly)
- [ ] Reached organizational/business root cause (not technical symptom)
- [ ] Impact quantified with numbers/metrics (not just described)
- [ ] Confirmed NOT still at symptom level
- [ ] Identified what changed to create problem
- [ ] Understand past attempts and why they failed

**Self-Check Question:**

"Have I reached the organizational/business decision that created this problem?"

‚Üí **YES** = Complete the dimension  
‚Üí **NO** = Ask "why" again

**Dimension Summary:**

Use universal format from Design Helper, populate with ACTUAL findings including:
- Root causes identified (not symptoms)
- "Why?" chain documented
- Impact quantified
- Problem relationships mapped
- Past attempts cataloged

   - What's the actual reality of the environment?
   - When and how often does this occur?

2. **Actual Workflows**
   - How do things REALLY work?
   - How does documented process differ from reality?
   - What informal processes exist?

3. **Ecosystem**
   - What systems are actually involved?
   - What dependencies exist in practice?
   - What tools do people combine?

4. **Organizational Dynamics**
   - What teams are involved?
   - What political factors influence this?
   - Who has decision authority?

5. **Cultural Context**
   - How has this historically been done?

   - What cultural norms affect adoption?

**Question Generation Principles:**

Generate questions that:
- Reveal how things REALLY work vs supposed to work
- Uncover informal processes and social dynamics
- Identify environmental constraints shaping behavior
- Map dependencies people work around
- Explore cultural factors influencing adoption
- **Apply domain-specific workflow understanding**
- **Focus on observable workflows** (not documented ones)

- [ ] 2+ gaps between actual vs documented process identified
- [ ] All systems and tools involved listed
- [ ] Dependencies understood (what breaks if X changes)
- [ ] Environmental constraints identified
- [ ] Organizational/political factors documented

**Self-Check Question:**

"Could I draw a diagram of how things actually work (not how they're supposed to work)?"

‚Üí **YES** = Complete the dimension  
‚Üí **NO** = Continue asking questions

**Dimension Summary:**

Use universal format from Design Helper, populate with ACTUAL findings including:
- Actual workflows (step-by-step)

   - Which policies are cultural vs required?

5. **User Constraints**
   - What are real accessibility needs?
   - What are actual usability requirements?
   - Which user "needs" are assumptions?

**Special Technique: Challenge EVERY "Can't"**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL for Constraints Dimension:**

Test every stated constraint to determine if it's real or assumed.

**Challenge Pattern:**
```
User: "We can't change X"
‚Üí Q: "What happens if we change it?"
‚Üí Q: "Who decided this and why?"
‚Üí Q: "What's the real cost of changing vs. cost of workaround?"
‚Üí Q: "Has anyone ever challenged this?"
‚Üí Q: "What would need to be true to change it?"
```

**Question Generation Principles:**

Generate questions that:
- Challenge every "we can't" statement
- Test if constraint is real or assumed
- Identify who decided the constraint and why
- Calculate real cost vs perceived cost
- Distinguish hard constraints from soft preferences
- Categorize as technical/business/policy/cultural
- **Test assumptions relentlessly**

**Completion Criteria:**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Check these BEFORE providing dimension summary:**

- [ ] Each "can't" statement tested with questions
- [ ] Constraints categorized (hard/soft/assumed)
- [ ] At least 1 assumption successfully challenged
- [ ] Negotiable vs non-negotiable constraints clear
- [ ] Real cost of changing documented
- [ ] Identified who has authority to change each constraint

**Self-Check Question:**

"Have I challenged every 'we can't' and determined which are real vs assumed?"

‚Üí **YES** = Complete the dimension  
‚Üí **NO** = Continue challenging assumptions

**Dimension Summary:**

Use universal format from Design Helper, populate with ACTUAL findings including:
- Real constraints (truly immutable)
- Soft constraints (changeable with effort/cost)
- Assumed constraints (actually negotiable)
- Who decides what
- Cost analysis of changing vs maintaining

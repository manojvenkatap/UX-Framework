# UX Research - Problem Finder

## Research Method Overview

Comprehensive problem discovery framework that explores problems from multiple dimensions to build deep understanding before moving to solutions.

**Research Goal:** Thoroughly understand the problem space, users, context, and constraints to inform effective design decisions.

## Mandatory Exploration Dimensions

### USER DIMENSION

**Purpose:** Understand who experiences this problem

**Explore until you can:**
- Describe user confidently
- Map key variations
- Identify constraints
- Explain context

**Research approach:**
- Start broad: Who interacts with this?
- Go specific: What's their context?
- Map variations: How do they differ?
- Identify edge cases: Who else might use this?

---

### PROBLEM DIMENSION

**Purpose:** Define what's wrong and why

**Explore until you can:**
- State problem clearly
- Explain root cause
- Quantify impact
- Define scope

**Research approach:**
- Define: What specific problem exists?
- Dig: Why does this problem exist? (5 whys)
- Assess: How big is this problem?
- Scope: What's in/out of bounds?

---

### CONTEXT DIMENSION

**Purpose:** Understand the environment and constraints

**Explore until you can:**
- Describe current workflow
- Identify technical constraints
- Understand business requirements
- Map stakeholder needs

**Research approach:**
- Current state: How do things work today?
- Constraints: What limits our solutions?
- Dependencies: What else is affected?
- Success criteria: How will we measure improvement?

## Research Techniques

### Adaptive Questioning

- Generate questions specific to THIS problem
- Build on previous answers intelligently
- Follow complexity when detected
- Probe gaps and assumptions
- Connect insights across dimensions

### One Question at a Time

- Ask single focused question
- Wait for answer
- Process answer deeply
- Determine next question based on answer
- Show your thinking process

### Sufficiency Checking

**After exploring each dimension, assess:**
- ✅ Do I have complete understanding?
- ✅ Are there gaps or ambiguities?
- ✅ Have I explored variations?
- ✅ Can I articulate this clearly?

**If ALL criteria met:** → Move to next dimension  
**If gaps remain:** → Continue exploring this dimension

---

## Completion Criteria

**Discovery complete when:**
- ✅ All dimensions thoroughly explored
- ✅ No major gaps remain
- ✅ Can write clear problem statement
- ✅ Cross-dimension patterns identified
- ✅ Sufficient foundation for design phase

## Notes

- Follow general research standards from Design Helper.md
- Use option system (1-3 + Save/Gap/Suggest) after each question
- Update Live Research Document after each Q&A
- Document must be created BEFORE first question
- Track token usage throughout research
- Use ⊕ additional questions when patterns emerge
